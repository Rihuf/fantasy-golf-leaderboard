Steps to take for the US OPEN implimentation:

Remove dates on Preview Leaderboard and add actual preview ---> lines 35-37 in TournamentBlock.js ---> remove tournament from the conditional.
Add get_usopen_data route on the golfer routes file (copy from masters/pga route).
+++ npm start and npm server need to be running from the server folder +++
+++ the above must be true for the routes to update and be accessible +++
+++ is npm server not working? try killing port 5000 +++
https://statdata.pgatour.com/r/current/message.json to get current Tournament ID (for the Open, it uses the same link -- an async issue determines what will display, just keep refreshing until you get the right one...)
Add new golfers with matching PGA ID, via postman route -- call the above route to populate the golfers.
Record new ObjectIds in sheets.google.com > TSO.
Add the golfers to the Player teams comes. 
Check Slack self DMs for instructions on copying local DB to mLab DB.
Edit the cronjob in scheduled-jobs.js
Check the setInterval function in the componentDidMount methods of TournamentGridPreview and Leaderboard -- make sure they are uncommented.
